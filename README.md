# Hi, I'm Tony 👋  

🔐 **Ethical Security Consultant | Penetration Tester | OSINT Specialist**  

Ranked in the **Top 1% on TryHackMe** and an active Hack The Box participant, I work as an **independent consultant** helping organizations identify risks, prove impact, and close security gaps — before attackers exploit them.  

I believe security should be **ethical**, **reproducible**, and **accessible** — especially in regions where awareness is low and risks are high. I bring a **strategic and analytical mindset** from my background in **logistics and supply chain**, combined with hands-on experience in **security testing**, **OSINT investigations**, and **responsible disclosure**. This blend allows me to approach security challenges with both **operational clarity** and **ethical intent** — turning complexity into **actionable defense**.

## 🛠 What I Do  
- Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments  
- OSINT & Recon Automation  
- Bug Bounty & Responsible Disclosure  
- Physical Security Assessments  
- QA Testing for Security, Performance & Functionality  

## ✍️ Blog & Knowledge Sharing  
I’m currently preparing **practical writeups and workflows** — from recon tips to penetration testing methodologies.  
My goal: make security **measurable, actionable, and ethical**.  
🕓 Coming soon.
